## Early Interests
Growing up, I’ve always been interested in technology, especially computers and figuring how they work. I had a game called Pixie Hollow that I invested a lot of time in when I was younger, which sparked my interest in computers and the creation of programs and software. My time spent playing flash games and investigating the different applications and settings on my family’s living room computer influenced my decision to go into technology and chose to major in Computer Science. 

I have a lot of interest in front-end engineering and specialization in UI and web design. I hope to get better at working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in the next year, as well as applications like Figma and Adobe XD and frameworks like React. Cloud architecture and computing is something that is also of interest to me because I was able to experiment with AWS during my previous internship and work on learning modules on cloud computing that made me curious about cloud solutions. 
## Future Horizons
There are so many areas of software engineering that I’d like to dip my toes into. My curiosity for technology has pushed me to keep exploring different areas of the field, from front-end development to cloud computing. As I continue through my degree and gain more hands-on experience, I am excited to use my growing skills to complete complex problems and contribute to meaningful projects.
