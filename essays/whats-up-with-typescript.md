## Typescript So Far..
As someone who wouldn’t exactly label myself as a coding pro, I would say that I find TypeScript to be a fun language to learn and work with. I learned JavaScript over the summer and still maintain a lot of knowledge from working with Java in previous courses so the learning curve wasn’t very steep at all. I appreciate that TypeScript has features like static typing, which automatically catches errors when compiling the code. The fact that it can also assign variable types without a user needing to explicitly state so is also very convenient, it almost feels like it’s less work! It’s because of this that I do think TypeScript is a good language to use from a software engineering perspective- it’s a reliable language that can help with catching any potential bugs or errors in code.

## WODs Aren't So Bad?
As for athletic software engineering, I thought that it would have been terrible when I first read our syllabus because as stated previously, I’m not that confident in my coding abilities. However, after doing a few practice WODs, I can say that they don’t seem to be as intimidating as I thought they would be. The fact that it’s timed actually seems more beneficial to me rather than scary because it’s a way of tracking how well you can understand a prompt and show that through your code. Even if a practice WOD is DNF, that result tells you that this is something that you need to work on in order to prepare for the actual WOD. I find this to be relieving compared to a quiz that is just thrown at you out of the blue. I do think that this will work for me because I’ve done okay so far on the practice WODs and they seem to cover things that are gone over in the coursework for that week. I’m mainly excited to see how my coding skills progress over the semester and I hope to see a lot of growth in my work and confidence!
