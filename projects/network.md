In my ICS 184 course, our instructor gave us the oppurtunity to make up a fictional company and create a network plan for them based on a building layout provided by our instructor. I decided to create a small Entertainment Engineering company with about 100-200 employees that would be working in this building. I had to create a plan that would be appopriate based on the layout of the building and possible obstructions that we could face.

Working on this independently, I had a couple challenges, with things like trees being along paths outside of the buildings, as well as no Wi-Fi on the first floor. I had to choose the type of cables used, type of Wi-Fi authentication, and more. I was able to create a structured cabling plan as well as a layout for placement of access points on the second floor. I was also able to add an outdoor access point for employees looking to work outside.

I found this project to be extremely helpful for me, like figuring out how to plan projects the same way that system architects would. I also exercised my complex thinking skills and had to work past different points that I had to consider about the building that I would need to keep in mind while placing cabling and access points.
