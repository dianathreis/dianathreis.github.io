During my summer interning at World Wide Technology, I had the oppurtunity to work with my colleagues on a capstone project. World Wide Technoloy gave us a problem, this being that retention rates for the newer generations, Gen Z and Millenials, were significantly lower than those of previous generations. We were then assigned with creating a solution to that problem that could be presented as a program or site.My group conducted research with current full-time employees of the company by sending out a survey that had individuals choose areas of the company that they thought could be improved. Our data showed that an overwhelming majority were unsatisfied with career development and progression, as well as rewards and recognition in World Wide Technology. It was because of this that we decided to create a platform that could encourage employees to further their learning and experience to progress within the company, and also earn rewards for it.

As a group, we created 'Learn the World Wide Way', which incorporated existing modules on the company website like Labs and Learning Grounds and Career Compass, but also included new functions, like a Career Roadmap and Rewards. A function that I got to design was a community engagement page, which would allow employees to post discussions related to careers and connect with colleagues based on skills, interests, and completed learning modules. 

After completing this project and presenting it to a board of judges as well as our fellow Intern class, I walked away with invaluable experience in UI design, project management, and collaboration. Although I've worked with all three of the mentioned skills, being able to collaborate with like-minded people from different parts of the US, and even the world, allowed me to see different insights that I don't think I would get to see in its entirety in a classroom.
